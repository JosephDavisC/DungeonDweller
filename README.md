# Dungeon Dweller  

![Dungeon Dweller Cover](cover.png)  

Dungeon Dweller is a **console-based adventure game** developed in C++ as my **final project for Term 2** of my **Database Design & Programming class in high school**.  

The project was my first larger C++ program, and it focuses on building fundamental programming concepts like object-oriented design, file handling, and simple game logic.
